# Parallax-Website

Welcome in new Project Repository of Parallax Scrolling Website of Seven Wonders of the world.

In this section we are going to discuss about what is Parallax Scrolling Website and how its work. Also we will take a closer look at all the difficulties I faced while creating this project.

What is Parallax Scrolling:

Parallax Scrolling is a visual effect where the background of a Web page appears to stay still while the foreground shifts vertically or horizontally. Parallax Scrolling is used to add visual interest to a webisite and engage users as they scroll through a web page.

So in Parallax Scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the backgrond typically moves much, more slowy, giving scrolling produces a fascinaying and seamless virtual experience.

If You want to add Parallax Scrolling effect to your website, you should consider the following tips:

1) Use it selectively:

Parallax scrolling is much more powerful when you use it on one particulr elemnet is opposed to all pages and all the time. use it in header and titlespr may be on your home page only. You want parallex scrolling to strengthen your websites design, not distract users.

2) Inage compression is key:

Parallax scrolling uses a variety of media files and CSS shapes to create a sense of depth. You dont want to compromise your web performance and user experience with large image files that load too slowly.

3) Play with color:

Parallax Scrolling isnt just about the images in the background and foreground, but about color, too. You might use more desaturated tones in the background more lively colors in the foreground to create an even greater sense of depth.
