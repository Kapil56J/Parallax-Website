           Seven wonders of the Wolrd

        <h2>Seven Wonders</h2>
        <p>
            WHEN IT COMES TO naming the world’s greatest hits, seven seems like an awfully small number. 
            Especially considering only one of the seven original, ancient wonders is still standing.
             In 2007, a Swiss foundation put it to the public to nominate a new crop of modern wonders,
              seizing the long overdue opportunity to recognize some of the most iconic sites on the planet today. 
              Millions voted, declaring the following new 7 wonders of the world worthier than the rest — unsurprisingly, 
              all seven are UNESCO World Heritage sites. From South America’s most famous citadel to the former stomping 
              grounds of Rome’s fiercest gladiators, these are the historic, iconic, and immensely photogenic 
              new Seven Wonders of the World, or New7Wonders for short.

           Taj Mahal, India

        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>
            The <span>Taj Mahal</span>  is a labor of love. Emperor <span>Shah Jahan</span>  built it in honor of his favorite wife,<span> Mumtaz Mahal</span>,
             who bore 14 children but died in labor. Jahan was lost without her, and in 1631, he began construction on 
             what is probably the world’s most elaborate and expensive mausoleum (though the tomb itself is unadorned per
              Muslim law).To see the white-marble masterpiece in person, head to <span> Agra </span>in the state of Uttar Pradesh, about 
              125 miles southeast of New Delhi.Construction required a rumored some 20,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants, who
               hauled marble from all over the region. The Taj is famously symmetrical, which is part of why it’s so beautiful
                to look at and photograph. It you go, go for sunrise before it gets overwhelmed with visitors.

               Christ the Redeemer, Brazil

    <section class="setion section-dark">
        <h2> Christ the Redeemer</h2>
        <p>
            This <span>iconic Christ statue</span>  is found in an equally iconic city, Rio de Janeiro. It was completed in 1931 
            (making it the newest of the new 7 wonders of the world), though a priest first proposed building a religious 
            monument on Mount Corcovado almost a century earlier. While Christ is often depicted on a cross, this towering, 
            bright white figure stands 98 feet tall with its arms outstretched. 
            Christ the Redeemer, or Cristo Redentor in Portuguese, offers beautiful views over the city, Sugarloaf Mountain,
             and the bay, particularly at sunset.

                Petra, Jorden
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <section class="setion section-light">
        <h2>Petra</h2>
        <p>
            Petra comes from the ancient Greek <span>Petros,</span>  meaning “rock,” which is a boring name for a very not 
            boring place. Petra is in the south of Jordan between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, a few hours’ drive from the
             capital city, Amman, and it’s believed to have been established around 300 BC.
            If you visit, go on a day when there is an after-dark event. Stay in the ruins until dusk, then head back to the 
            Treasury. You’ll be treated with candlelight and a view before the crowds arrive.

                The Great Wall of China
            </span>

    <section class="setion section-dark">
        <h2>The Great Wall</h2>
        <p>
            The Great Wall is something of a <span> misnomer.</span> The wall is not actually continuous but many walls built at
             different times and for different reasons; many were joined together, but gaps still exist. Some parts of the wall
              feel newer and almost pristine — these were built during the Ming Dynasty when the Ming were at war with Mongolians 
              around the 1300s. The older walls date back as far as 700 BC (which makes it the oldest of the new 7 Wonders of the
               World), and these sections show their age today.
            Still, the Great Wall weaves and winds over the hills where China borders Mongolia, measuring about 20,000 kilometers
             (12,427 miles) and crossing nine provinces.

            The Colosseum, Roma
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <section class="setion section-light">
        <h2>The Colosseum</h2>
        <p>
           This beauty, though it belongs to the new 7 wonders of the world, was commissioned in Rome around 70 AD.
            The <span>massive amphitheater</span>  has over 80 entrances and seating for at least 50,000 people. Spectators would come to 
            watch gladiators battle, animals fight or be hunted, and much more. While some parts of the Colosseum have
             crumbled — from earthquakes, looters, vandals, or fire — it’s still a gorgeous sight, even despite the throngs of 
             tourists.
           The Colosseum is open from 8:30 AM to an hour before sunset every day. Standard admission is about $13 and allows
            access to the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill.

           Machu Pichhu, Peru

    <section class="setion section-dark">
        <h2> Machu Pichhu</h2>
        <p>
            <span> Machu Picchu</span> is one of the most impressive sites in Peru — and on the planet. Built 7,000 feet above sea level, 
            the ancient citadel dates back to the height of the Incan Empire in the 15th century. It’s estimated that only 
            about 750 people lived here as it was a royal estate rather than a proper city. In the native tongue, Quechua,
             the name means <span>Old Peak,</span>  but the excellently constructed site wears its age gracefully and is impressively 
             maintained.
            Machu Picchu is open year-round with summer being peak season. To get there, take a train from Cusco to the town
             of Aguas Calientes, where you can hike or take a bus to the entrance.

            Chichen Itza, Maxico
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <section class="setion section-light">
        <h2>Chichen Itza</h2>
        <p>
            Found in the Yucatán state, Chichén Itzá is a massive Mayan city that was once a powerhouse in the area.
             Its heyday was from around 600 AD to 1200 AD, and its name translates to <span>at the mouth at the well of Itza.</span>
             As to what Itza is, it’s believed to refer to an ethnic group or translate to <span>enchanter of the waters</span>
             The name makes sense either way as the Yucatán Peninsula is famous for its underwater rivers and open freshwater
              sinkholes, called cenotes. Water was integral to life here — and likely a factor in the city’s success before
               its eventual, mysterious decline.
            Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds, or plan your visit around an equinox to witness the serpent-like 
            effect of the sun on the steps of El Castillo.
